      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Athul, a passionate developer who started building things before most people knew what HTML was.
        I love turning ideas into real web experiences. Whether it’s a smooth app, a slick UI, or a next-gen web game — I make it happen.
        If i say about me i started my coding journey at 12 years.

      <h2>My journey - where i walked alone</h2>
      <p>
        It was started at 12 years. There my dream is succesed by creating first game in scratch. And that ideas and logic turned my to a gmaerz.
        And i have a  mentality to find anything. That lead to find how the games created , In the limitations of scratch lead me to coding.
       Then my mind lead to html and began as a large power to create my dream active. And that lead to big websites with java script.
        And now i am one of a web devloper under learning in my own ideas.
